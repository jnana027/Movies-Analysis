
->Retrieve data using numeric query (BETWEEN,IN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET)

-> <, ≤, >, ≥ are the basic numerical operators used in SQL.

->You can also use AND, OR, BETWEEN, and IN to perform numerical queries.

->You can sort the table by using the ‘ORDER BY’ clause.

->By default, it sorts the data in ascending order but you can specify the sort order.

->LIMIT clause can be used to fetch the top ‘N’ or bottom ‘N’ amount of records. ‘N’ can be any numerical value.

->OFFSET clause will help you to skip a certain number of rows in your final result.
