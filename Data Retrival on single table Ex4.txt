HAVING Clause:

->The order of query execution in SQL is FROM
                                  →WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → ORDER BY
->GROUP BY and HAVING clauses are often used together.

->The column you use in HAVING should be present in SELECT clause whereas, WHERE can usecolumns that is not present in select clause as well.

Example:

-- Print all the years where more than 2 movies were released
	SELECT 
           release_year, 
           count(*) as movies_count
	FROM movies    
	GROUP BY release_year
	HAVING movies_count>2
	ORDER BY movies_count DESC;


Calculated columns (IF, CASE, YEAR, CURYEAR):

->You can derive new columns from the existing columns in a table.

->As a data analyst, Revenue and Profit are the most common metrics that you will calculate in any
 industry.

->Currency conversion and unit conversion are important business use cases of SQL.

->IF function is often used in SQL queries.

->When you have more than two conditions, you need to use CASE and END functions instead of the IF function.

Examples:

-- Print actor name, their birth_year and age
	SELECT 
           name, birth_year, (YEAR(CURDATE())-birth_year) as age
	FROM actors;

-- Print profit for every movie
	SELECT 
	    *, 
           (revenue-budget) as profit 
	from financials;

-- Print revenue of all movies in INR currency
	SELECT 
           movie_id, 
	   revenue, 
           currency, 
           unit,
           IF (currency='USD', revenue*77, revenue) as revenue_inr
	FROM financials;

-- Get all the unique units from financial table
	select 
	   distinct unit 
	From financials;

-- Print revenue in millions 
	SELECT 
           movie_id, revenue, currency, unit,
           CASE
              WHEN unit="Thousands" THEN revenue/1000
              WHEN unit="Billions" THEN revenue*1000
             ELSE revenue
           END as revenue_mln
	FROM financials

-- 1. Print profit % for all the movies
       select *,concat(round((revenue-budget)*100/budget,2),"%") as  "Profit %"  from financials
