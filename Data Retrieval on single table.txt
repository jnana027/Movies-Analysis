Data Retrieval on single table:

->SELECT, FROM, and WHERE are the basic SQL functions.

->‘*’ means all columns. Using ‘*’ after the SELECT query will select all columns of a database.

->With the help of the USE function, you can indicate the query to use a particular database, especially when there are multiple databases.

->The COUNT function will provide the numerical count of rows.

->The DISTINCT function will help you see the unique values present in a given column.

->‘%’ is a wild card search.

->Use the LIKE function and ‘%’ to filter the rows based on a text value.
